## 1. Session Objectives

| # | Goal |
|---|------|
| 1 | Restore reliable scraping after Cloudflare hard-blocked original Playwright workflow |
| 2 | Investigate paid proxy / rendering services (ScraperAPI) as fallback |
| 3 | Make the project proxy-aware and future-proof (env-driven) |
| 4 | Capture every failure path and document remediation steps |

---

## 2. Work Performed

### 2.1 Codebase Changes

* **Stealth upgrade** – removed deprecated `stealth_sync` & `stealth_async`; now use `Stealth().apply_stealth_sync/async` (playwright-stealth ≥ 2.0).
* **Proxy hooks** – added optional `SAHIBI_PROXY` handling to both sync & async scrapers.
* **New scraper class** – `SahibindenScraperAPI` (HTML via ScraperAPI REST + BeautifulSoup parser).
* **Env-vars introduced**  
  `SCRAPERAPI_KEY`, `SCRAPERAPI_EXTRA_PARAMS`, `SAHIBI_PROXY`.
* **convert_opera_cookies.py** – TSV → `cf_cookies.json` helper.

### 2.2 Experiments & Probes

| Step | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Cookie reuse w/ matching UA | Cloudflare still served check ➜ IP reputation issue |
| Playwright w/ ScraperAPI proxy (no render) | Loads but still Cloudflare loop (because HTML stub) |
| ScraperAPI REST `render=true` | 500 Internal Server Error – domain flagged *Protected* |
| Added `premium=true` | 500 → account lacks Premium tier |
| Added `ultra_premium=true` | 403 → account not authorised |
| Direct proxy test with `requests` | Works after `verify=False`, proves proxy reachable; SSL warning expected |

### 2.3 Installation hiccup

Editable install (`pip install -e .`) failed – venv's *pip* executable missing → skipped, used `PYTHONPATH` workaround.

## 3. Failure Analysis

### 3.1 Cloudflare Cookie Rejection

* Probable cause: IP / ASN reputation.  Cookie + fingerprint pair was valid (confirmed via manual browser) but different IP made clearance invalid.
* Mitigation paths:
  1. Use residential proxy pool.
  2. Re-grab cookies periodically from same IP block.

### 3.2 ScraperAPI 5xx / 403 Chain

| Error | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| 500 "Protected domain, add premium=true" | Free plan lacks Premium | Upgrade or remove render flag |
| 500 after premium flag | Domain actually requires Ultra-Premium | Upgrade to Ultra plan |
| 403 after ultra_premium=true | Account still not upgraded | Confirm billing / credits |
| SSL verify fail in proxy mode | MITM cert from proxy | Use `verify=False` (requests) or rely on Playwright default |

---

## 4. Current Status

* **Playwright scrapers** functional when:
  * Valid `cf_cookies.json` present **and**
  * Traffic sent through IP range Cloudflare accepts (residential proxy works).
* **ScraperAPI REST path** blocked until Premium/Ultra-Premium upgrade.
* **Codebase** compiles & unit tests pending.

---

## 5. Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Choose an IP strategy**  
   a. Upgrade ScraperAPI to Ultra-Premium (50 credits / request) and keep HTML-only scraper.  
   b. Cheaper: use ScraperAPI **proxy-only** (1 credit) + local Playwright rendering.
2. **Automate env handling** – commit `.env.example`, document required vars in README.
3. **Repair editable install** – run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` inside venv, then `pip install -e .`.
4. **Add health checks & fallbacks** – detect 403/500 and switch proxy or cooldown.
5. **Persist output** – finish Redis queue, SQLite/Postgres integration (Phase 2 roadmap).
6. **Testing** – write unit tests for new `SahibindenScraperAPI`, URLBuilder, DataValidator.

---

## 6. Alternative Ideas

* **Hybrid scraping** – use API for HTML (no JS) + Playwright only for pages that need interaction.
* **Mobile proxies** – higher clearance success; evaluate cost vs Ultra-Premium.
* **Serverless deployment** – AWS Lambda + rotating proxies to off-load local machine.
